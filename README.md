**Project Overview**
DriverPass is a company that helps students better prepare for their driving exams. After noticing that a large percentage of students were failing because they only studied previous tests, DriverPass wanted to create a system that would give students access to online practice exams and real on-the-road training sessions.
The system needed to support multiple users, including students, instructors, management, and IT staff.

-Reflection
What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job gathering and organizing the client’s requirements into a clear business document. I also feel like my system design covered the main goals DriverPass wanted to achieve without overcomplicating things.

-If you could revise one part of your work, what would it be? How would you improve it?
If I could change something, I would spend more time improving the detail in the UML diagrams. I would also try to make the Gantt chart a little more specific by breaking down some of the larger tasks into smaller steps.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is considering the user’s needs 
 important?
I made sure to focus on what users actually needed, not just what sounded good technically. For example, making sure students could easily schedule driving sessions was a big priority. Considering user needs is important because if the system doesn’t work for them, it doesn’t matter how well it’s built — they won’t use it.

-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a 
 system?
I usually start by gathering requirements and creating basic diagrams to map out the system. In the future, I want to get better at using user stories and feedback early on to catch issues before they grow. I’d also like to use more prototyping tools to test ideas faster.
